<H2> 1. SEA Life </H2>

They have fishes, sharks, turtles and pengiuns. Also you are near the river and other attractions like the Shrek's Adventure and the London Dungeons.

<H2> 2. Ballie Ballerson </H2>

This is a ball pit but not the kind for children. It is perfect for taking cute photos and they have cheap pizza and drinks all in one place.

<H2> 3. London Bridge </H2>

There is so much in London Bridge my favourite place here is RVU of course. This place is really busy so if you do not like that this may not be the place for you.
