Hi! Nice to meet you! I am delighted that you've chosen to join me here.

My name is Cathy, and I'm currently a second-year Economics student at Warwick. I've had the privilege of spending 18 years in China and the past 2 years in England. Throughout my journey, I've embarked on various adventures, including volunteer teaching, solo traveling, and birthday hiking trips. My goal has always been to delve into the essence of each destination and fully immerse myself in its unique culture and experiences.

This website serves as both a showcase of my coding skills and a platform for sharing my solo travel tips, recommended routes for different states, and exciting interactive features. I'm dedicated to continuously updating the website to provide you with fresh content new web functions and inspiration for your own travels.

The background photo of this website holds a special place in my heart. Despite the snow-covered peaks, the mountains still emanate a powerful presence. It symbolizes resilience, determination, and the ups and downs of life. In my perspective, solo travel is far from being a lonely endeavor; it's an extraordinary experience that mirrors the strength and beauty of these mountains.

I hope this webpage ignites your imagination, sparks new travel ideas, and encourages you to open yourself up to the world. I'm thrilled to be a friend and companion on your journey. Feel free to connect with me through the social media links provided below. Let's embark on this exciting adventure together!
