54 countries in Africa state are going to be explored by you with Cathy.

The photo above, taken in South Africa in August 2022, encapsulates Cathy's transformative 6-week volunteer teaching experience. Immersed in Africa's vibrant culture, Cathy was deeply impressed by the warmth of its people and the richness of its history. This extraordinary journey has fundamentally changed her, shaping her into a person with a more comprehensive global vision and prompting her to rethink the interconnectedness of people, nature, and the world.
