<H2> 1. Japan </H2>

I want to go here for the large variety and innovative goods you can buy here and I love shopping. There are also attractions here like Disney Land and beautiful scenery of sakura plants.

<H2> 2. Phuket </H2>

Thailand has been on my list for ages now. I really like the idea of the beaches, food and drinks here. It is also known for being cheap.
